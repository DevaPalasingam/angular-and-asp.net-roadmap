# AngularNet Learning Roadmap

## Angular/C#/ASP.NET/MVC

Based on a lot of job postings these days (as of Sept 2023) it seems like this stack is the main industry-standard (i.e. big companies not startups) for company websites. I tried googling and asking ChatGPT for a name for this stack but I couldn't seem to find one. So, for now, I have dubbed this stack the name **_AngularNet_**.

I intentionally didn't call this repo AngularNet in case someone corrects me and tells me this stack already has a name. But until then, I will call it AngularNet.

ChatGPT helped me come up with this project-based learning roadmap. I hope this will be helpful to people (and me) who would like to continue/start their career in Full-stack development.

My hope is to link my own projects and code as I work through this roadmap as well.

## Project 1: Hello World Angular App

- **Concepts:**
  - Setting up a development environment (Node.js, npm)
  - Creating an Angular project
  - Understanding components, templates, and data binding
  - Basic routing and navigation
- **Description:** Create a simple "Hello World" Angular application that introduces you to the basics of setting up Angular and navigating between different views.

See the code [here](https://github.com/DevaPalasingam/hello-angular).

## Project 2: Simple Task List Application

- **Concepts:**
  - Creating and managing components and services
  - Angular forms for user input
  - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Angular HTTP client for API interactions
- **Description:** Build a task list application where users can add, view, update, and delete tasks. Learn how to work with forms and make HTTP requests.

## Project 3: ASP.NET Core Web API for Task List

- **Concepts:**
  - Setting up an ASP.NET Core Web API project
  - Creating RESTful API endpoints for tasks
  - Implementing CRUD operations in the API
  - Handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- **Description:** Develop a back-end API using ASP.NET Core that serves as the data source for the task list application.

## Project 4: Integrating Angular with ASP.NET Core Web API

- **Concepts:**
  - Making HTTP requests from Angular to the API
  - Handling asynchronous operations with Observables
  - Error handling and validation in Angular
  - Authentication and authorization (basic)
- **Description:** Connect your Angular front-end to the ASP.NET Core API, enabling users to interact with the task list through the UI.

## Project 5: Authentication and User Management

- **Concepts:**
  - Implementing user registration and login in Angular
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
  - Secure routes and authorization
  - Storing user data and tokens in Angular
- **Description:** Enhance the task list app by adding user registration and login functionality with secure authentication.

## Project 6: Advanced Features and Optimization

- **Concepts:**
  - Advanced Angular components (e.g., modals, dropdowns)
  - Optimizing Angular performance (lazy loading, Ahead-of-Time compilation)
  - Pagination and sorting in API
  - Caching strategies for better API performance
- **Description:** Implement advanced features in the task list app and optimize its performance for larger datasets.

## Project 7: Deployment and CI/CD

- **Concepts:**
  - Setting up a production-ready build process
  - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines
  - Environment variables for different deployment stages
  - Docker for containerization (optional)
- **Description:** Learn how to deploy your Angular/C#/ASP.NET Core application to a production environment and set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.
